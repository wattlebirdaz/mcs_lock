# Build

```
g++ main.cpp mcs_lock.cpp -lpthread -Ofast
```

# Performance

Benchmarking is done by incrementing a shared counter using `8 core Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900 CPU @ 3.10GHz with 32GB RAM`, 2 threads per core.
`std::mutex` seems to win most of the time except for single threaded execution.
